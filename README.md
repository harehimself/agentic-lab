## Agentic Lab
An advanced research laboratory for developing autonomous AI agents with sophisticated reasoning, planning, and collaboration capabilities for next-generation AI systems.

<br>

## Features
- Multi-agent system architectures
- Advanced reasoning and planning algorithms
- Dynamic tool use and adaptation
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- Task delegation and workflow management
- Emergent behavior exploration
- Self-improving agent systems

<br>


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harehimself/agentic-lab.git
cd agentic-lab
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp config/agents.yaml.example config/agents.yaml
# Edit configuration files for your use case
```

<br>

## Quick Start
1. Launch a basic autonomous agent:
```bash
python src/agents/basic_agent.py --task "analyze data and provide insights"
```

2. Start multi-agent collaboration:
```bash
python experiments/multi_agent_collaboration.py
```

3. Run agent benchmarks:
```bash
python tests/agent_benchmarks.py
```

## Agent Types
The lab includes several specialized agent architectures:

- **Research Agent**: Information gathering and analysis
- **Planning Agent**: Strategy development and execution
- **Tool Agent**: Dynamic tool discovery and utilization
- **Communication Agent**: Inter-agent coordination
- **Reflection Agent**: Self-evaluation and improvement
- **Swarm Agents**: Collective intelligence systems
