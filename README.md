## Overview  
Agentic Lab serves as a launchpad for developing, testing, and refining autonomous AI agents. Whether you're building research prototypes or production-ready systems, this environment provides the tools and abstractions necessary to experiment with cognition, decision flows, and agent interoperability.  

## Features  
- üß† Modular agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen)  
- üóÇÔ∏è Tool chaining and execution environments  
- üß≠ ReAct and CoT-based reasoning templates  
- üíæ Memory integration with vector DBs  
- ‚ö° Fast prototyping with reusable agent components  
- üîÑ Support for multi-agent orchestration  

## Getting Started  
Clone the repo and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harehimself/agentic-lab.git  
cd agentic-lab  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

Run your first agent:  
```bash
python examples/run_agent.py  
```

## Agent Architectures  
Each agent is designed using a combination of modular strategies:  
- **Reasoning:** Chain-of-Thought, ReAct  
- **Planning:** Declarative tasks, LangGraph flows  
- **Memory:** Vector DB (Pinecone, ChromaDB)  
- **Tool Use:** Custom functions, external APIs  
- **Control:** Autonomous or human-in-the-loop  

## Use Cases  
- Real-time task automation  
- Retrieval-augmented knowledge agents  
- Workflow orchestrators  
- Decision support copilots
